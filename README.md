# Trivia-Game

#### HW #5 for The Coding Bootcamp at UT Austin

For this assignment I created a trivia game using Javascript for the logic, jQuery to manipulate HTML, and my knowledge of time-outs to implement a countdown timer. 


I created a trivia form with multiple choice options and a countdown timer so the player will have a limited amount of time to finish the quiz.


The game ends when the time runs out or the user submits his answers before then. 

The next page will reveal the number of questions that players answer correctly and incorrectly.
